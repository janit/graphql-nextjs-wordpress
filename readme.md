## GraphQL and Next.js

- <a href="https://graphql.org">GraphQL</a> &mdash; kudos <a href="https://facebook.com">FB</a> + Community
  - Transfer protocol + Query Language
  - An alternative to REST, but more defined
  - Independent of backend technology
- <a href="https://github.com/zeit/next.js/">Next.js</a> &mdash; kudos <a href="http://zeit.co">Zeit</a> + Community
  - A Universal JavaScript framework
  - Runs in the browser and server (with Node.js)
  - Templating using React.js
- GraphQL + Next.js
  - A nice combo for decoupled app/site building
  - We'll see how it works soon enough

## GraphQL and PHP

- GraphQL reference implementation in JavaScript
- Two mature GraphQL libraries for PHP
  - <a href="https://github.com/webonyx/graphql-php">WebOnyx GraphQL library</a>
  - <a href="https://github.com/Youshido/GraphQL">Youshido GraphQL library</a>
- Both solid and feature complete in my experience
- Please don't write your own GraphQL library!

--

## GraphQL and WordPress
- WordPress does not ship with GraphQL support
- WPGraphQL plugin adds GraphQL support
  - Uses the WebOnyx library, stable foundations
  - Good coverage from what I explored
  - eZ to use &mdash; even a WP noob could do it
  - Open for custom API extensions
  - More: https://wpgraphql.com
- There are others, but this worked great for me

---

## WordPress and Next.js

- Two independent technologies
- Completely decoupled:
  - Next.js the presentation framework
  - WordPress the data source
- GraphQL is the common ground
- A solid foundation for <a href="https://malloc.fi/pwas-fulfill-promise-of-iphone-for-web-developers">PWA</a>s

# Hot or not

--

## Hot

- No compromise SEO
- A fresh approach, learn new things
- GraphQL syntax is legi… ble
- Not tied to any system

---

## Not hot

- Lose all the WP sitebuilding bonuses
- WPGraphQL plugin compatibility?
- Added complexity… for what?
- It's fair to say GraphQL is overengineered
